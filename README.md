# Motorcade-Management-System
The MMS (Motorcade Management System) is a winform application that aims at computerizing the entire process of motorcade management, for every motorcade business to help save time and protect automobile assets to both the motor vehicle industry and motorcade companies. This software manages different types of data procedures by modules, in motorcade firms for vehicle fleets. It keeps track of the information about the vehicles, maintenance, repair, parts, employees, location and vendors. The super users of the system are ‘ADMIN’ and the ‘MANAGERS’ of the different departments allocated by the admin. The Admin may be the owner of the transportation organization or the manager of transportation department of a particular manufacturing firm. The details about the functions, design and development of the product are well described and demonstrated.
